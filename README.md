### Hello!

According to statistics I collect by myself, my name is hard to pronounced which is why I go by my official nickname, **Gun**. I will graduate from the **School of Computing, KAIST** in February 2023. My research interest is machine learning in general, but you may find some other interesting stuff here as well. Enjoy discovering!

My personal website is available [here](https://gunsodo.github.io). Feel free to take a look!
