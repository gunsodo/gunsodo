### Hello!

According to statistics I collect by myself, my name is hard to pronounce which is why I go by **Gun** or **Tau**. I am working at [Gauss Labs](https://www.gausslabs.ai/) as an Applied Scientist after I graduated from the **School of Computing, KAIST**. My research interest is machine learning in general, but you may find some other interesting stuff here as well. Enjoy discovering!

My personal website is available [here](https://gunsodo.github.io). Feel free to take a look!
